Vaadin is a mythological creature in Finnish folklore, the goddess and
divine ancestor of the mountain reindeer. It appears frequently in the
poetic mythos, often as the trustworthy steed of either *Seppo
Ilmarinen* or *Väinämöinen*, the two divine hero figures. In many of the
stories, it is referred to as *Steed of Seppo* or *Seponratsu* in
Finnish. An artifact itself, according to most accounts, Vaadin helped
Seppo Ilmarinen in his quests to find the knowledge necessary to forge
magical artefacts, such as *Sampo*.

Some of the Vaadin poems were collected by *Elias Lönnrot*, but he left
them out of *Kalevala*, the Finnish epic poem, as they were somewhat
detached from the main theme and would have created inconsistencies with
the poems included in the epos. Lönnrot edited Kalevala heavily and it
represents a selection from a much larger and more diverse body of
collected poems. Many of the accounts regarding Vaadin were sung by
shamans, and still are. A shamanistic tradition, centered on the tales
of Seppo and Vaadin, still lives in South-Western Finland, around the
city of Turku. Some research in the folklore suggests that the origin of
Vaadin is as a shamanistic animal spirit used during trance for voyaging
to *Tuonela*, the Land of Dead, with its mechanical construction
reflecting the shamanistic tools used for guiding the trance. While the
shamanistic interpretation of the origins is disputed by a majority of
the research community in a maximalist sense, it is considered a
potentially important component in the collection of traditions that
preserve the folklore.

Origin or birth poems, *synnyt* in Finnish, provide the most distinct
accounts of mythological artefacts in the Finnish folklore, as origin
poems or songs were central in the traditional magical practices. Vaadin
is no exception and its origin poems are numerous. In many of the
versions, Vaadin was created in a mill, for which Seppo had built the
millstone. After many a year, grinding the sacred acorns of the *Great
Oak* (a version of the *World Tree* in Finnish mythology), the millstone
had become saturated with the magical juices of the acorns. Seppo found
that the stone could be used to make tools. He cut it in many pieces and
built a toolkit suitable for fashioning spider web into any imaginable
shape. When Seppo started making Sampo, he needed a steed that would
help him find the precious components and the knowledge he required. The
magical tools became the skeleton of Vaadin.

>                     forge bone out of stone,
>                     flesh out of moss,
>                     and skin of bark of the birch.
>                     The length of his hammer,
>                     he put as the spine and the hip,
>                     bellows as the lungs,
>                     tongs as the legs, paired.
>                     So woke Vaadin from the first slumber,
>                     lichen did Seppo give her for eating,
>                     mead did he give her for drinking,
>                     then mounted her for the journey."

Other versions associate the creation with Väinämöinen instead of Seppo
Ilmarinen, and give different accounts for the materials. This ambiguity
can be largely explained through the frequent cooperation between
Väinämöinen and Seppo in the mythos.

The Kalevala associates a perverted Vaadin-like creature with the evil
antagonist *Hiisi*. The creature, *Elk of Hiisi*, is chased by
*Lemminkäinen*, the third hero in Kalevala. While this is antithetical
to the other accounts of Vaadin, it is noteworthy in how it blurs the
distinction between the mountain reindeer and elk, and how it makes
clear that the steed is an artificial construct.

>     But the boast was heard by Hiisi,
>     And by Juutas comprehended;
>     And an elk was formed by Hiisi,
>     And a reindeer formed by Juutas,
>     With a head of rotten timber,
>     Horns composed of willow-branches,
>     Feet of ropes the swamps which border,
>     Shins of sticks from out the marshes;
>     And his back was formed of fence-stakes,
>     Sinews formed of dryest grass-stalks,
>     Eyes of water-lily flowers,
>     Ears of leaves of water-lily,
>     And his hide was formed of pine-bark,
>     And his flesh of rotten timber.
>     (Translation by W. F. Kirby, 1907)

Nevertheless, proper names are rarely used, so the identity of the steed
or steeds remains largely implicit in the myths and, because of the
differences in the origin myths, can not be unambiquously associated
with a unique identity.

The theme of animal ancestor gods is common in the Finnish myth, as we
can see in the widespread worship of *Tapio*, the lord of the bear and
the forest. With respect to Vaadin, the identification of the animal is
not completely clear. The Finnish word *vaadin* refers specifically to
an adult female of the semi-domesticated mountain reindeer, which lives
in the Northern Finland in Lapland as well as in the Northern Sweden and
Norway. On the other hand, the Finnish folklore represented in Kalevala
and other collections has been collected from Southern Finland, where
the mountain reindeer does not exist. Nevertheless, Southern Finnish
folklore and Kalevala do include many other elements as well that are
distinctively from Lapland, such as the hunting of the Elk of Hiisi, so
we may assume that the folklore reflects a record of cultural
interaction. The distinction between the northern mountain reindeer and
the deer species of Southern Finland, the forest reindeer and the elk,
is clear in the modern language, but may have been less clear in old
Finnish dialects, as is reflected in the Kalevala account. *Peura*,
reindeer, may have been a generic word for a wild animal, as can be seen
in *jalopeura*, the old Finnish word for lion. Kalevala uses the
*poropeura* in the Lemminkäinen story to distinguish the specific
sub-type of reindeer. The identification is further complicated by the
fact that other lines of poems included in Kalevala often refer to a
horse in association with Seppo and Väinämöinen. To some extent, this
could be due to the use of the word for horse as a generic name for a
steed. While a mountain reindeer is not suitable for riding, animal gods
are typically portrayed as uncommonly large in mythology, even to the
extremes, so the identification fits quite well in the variety of
magical mounts.

The mythology related to Vaadin, especially as represented in Kalevala,
locates some important characters and people in *Pohjola*, a mythical
land in the north from where all evil originates, according to most
accounts. For example, *Louhi* or Pohjolan emäntä, Queen of Pohjola, is
the primary antagonist in the Kalevala mythos. Both Seppo Ilmarinen and
Väinämöinen make services to Louhi to earn the hand of her daughters for
marriage. Vaadin is often mentioned in connection with these services,
such as the making of Sampo. On the other hand, as Sampo can be
identified with the mill mentioned in creation stories of Vaadin, its
identification in the stories becomes unclear.

While beginning its life as an artifact, Vaadin is later represented as
an antropomorphic divine being. This is in contrast with the *Bride of
Gold*, another creation of Seppo, which failed to become a fully living
and thinking being. Finding magical ways around fundamental problems in
life are central in Kalevala. In some areas, magical solutions are
morally acceptable, while in others they are not and the successes and
failures in the mythos reflect this ethic. Research in the folklore
regarding the Bride of Gold myth has provided support for a theory that
creating a wife would go against very fundamental social rules of
courting and mating, paralleling the disapproval of "playing god" in
acts involving life and death (though "cheating death" is usually
considered a positive act). The main motivation of the protagonists in
Kalevala is courting young daughters, which always ends in failure,
usually for similar reasons. Animals, such as Vaadin, are outside the
social context and considered to belong in the same category with tools
and machines. The Vaadin myths present a noteworthy example of this
categorization of animals and tools in the same category at an
archetypal level.

The Vaadin myths parallel the *Sleipnir* myths in the Scandinavian
mythology. This connection is especially visible for the connection of
Väinämöinen with *Odin*, who used Sleipnir in his journeys. The use of
tongs for the legs of Vaadin actually suggests eight legs, which is the
distinguishing attribute of Sleipnir. While Sleipnir is almost
universally depicted as a horse, the exact identification of the steed
may have changed during the transmission between the cultures.

The *Bridle of Vaadin* is a special artifact itself. There is no
headstall, but only the rein, detached from the creature, kept in the
hand of the rider. The rein is a chain or set of "gadgets" used for
controlling the creature. The rein was built of web with special tools,
with Seppo wearing magnifying goggles to work out the small details.

The significance and cultural influence of Vaadin can be seen in its
identification with a constellation in the traditional Finnish
constellation system. The famous French astronomer *Pierre Charles Le
Monnier* (1715-99), who visited Lapland, introduced the constellation to
international star charts with the name *Tarandus vel Rangifer*. The
constellation was present in many star charts of the time, perhaps most
notably in the *Uranographia* published in 1801 by *Johann Elert Bode*,
as shown in ?. It was later removed in the unification of the
constellation system towards the Greek mythology.
